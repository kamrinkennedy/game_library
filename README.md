# Game Library

Game Library is a website that allows users to sign up for an account and store/manage their games in an 
online database. Users may add any number of different platforms as well as assign new games to whichever
platform they choose. You also have the option to view the other users of the website, where you can see 
all of the games that they have added to their own collections.
